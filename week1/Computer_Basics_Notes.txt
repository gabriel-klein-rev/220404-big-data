Computer Basics

- Processor
	- Brain of your computer
	- Run commands written in machine code

- Storage (HDD, SSD)
	- Long term memory
	- Only part of your computer that preserves anything after you shut it down

- RAM (Random Access Memory)
	- Short term memory
	- Where inputs and outputs of commands are stored, and where your running programs are stored
	- Fast

- Cluster
	- Network of multiple systems that work together as a single unit

- Node
	- Single machine inside a cluster
	- Single-node cluster
		- Cluster with one node

- OS (operating system)
	- Unix-like OS
		- Ubuntu
		- Many Big Data tools work only/better on Unix-like OS

- Binaries
	- Applications that can be run (bin => binaries)
	- Written in machine code which can be interpreted by our processor

- Shell/Terminal/CLI (Command Line Interface)
	- Interface that allows users to communicate with the kernel (core of OS)

- Kernel
	- Core of our OS
	- Control all tasks of the system

- VM (Virtual machine)
	- Like running an OS on hardware, but on virtual "hardware"
	- Resources are allocated from the actual hardware to run a VM
