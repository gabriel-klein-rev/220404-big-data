asdf@asdf.com This is a random string of words with
some ghr@irn.net emails mixed in. Your job is to create
a regular potrjeb@asdf expression that can find all of 
the valid emails in this file. Be careful thoughm, there
are some strings like asdfert3456@vfr that look like 
emails email@web.com but actually are not proper syntax
for emails. Do your best! You should find that gk77@email.com
there are 6 hgte456@covid.gov emails throughout this 
file. Some of them have weird names 123abc@easy.ume but
a valid email qwerasdf@qwer consists of alphanumeric 
characters, including underscores, followed by an '@'
symbol, then more alphanumeric symbols, followed by a
'.' then a 2-4 letter code.
